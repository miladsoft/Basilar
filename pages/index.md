# Welcome to Basilar

Basilar is a very easy way to get started with Markdown to HTML generation.

There are many feature rich alternatives to Basilar, go use those if you need more features.

Basilar is basic, will always be basic, but it does the job well if all you need is some basic generation and publishing.
